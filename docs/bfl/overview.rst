The Bayesian Filtering Library
==============================

The Bayesian Filtering Library (BFL)
`[ref] <https://orocos.org/bfl/referring_to_bfl>`_
provides an application independent framework for inference in Dynamic Bayesian
Networks, i.e., recursive information processing and estimation algorithms based
on Bayes' rule, such as (Extended) Kalman Filters, Particle Filters (or
Sequential Monte Carlo methods), etc. These algorithms can, for example, be run
on top of the Realtime Services, or be used for estimation in Kinematics &
Dynamics applications.
