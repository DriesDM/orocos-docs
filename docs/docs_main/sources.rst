Toolchain
+++++++++

The code base of the Orocos project is open and distributed over multiple
repositories.

- `Orocos toolchain <https://github.com/orocos-toolchain/orocos_toolchain>`_:
  A metapackage that describes the dependencies of Orocos core components.
- `RTT <https://github.com/orocos-toolchain/rtt>`_:
  The core Real Time Toolchain.
- `OCL <https://github.com/orocos-toolchain/ocl>`_:
  The Orocos Component Library that provides basic components to deploy
  an application based on Orocos components.
- `Log4Cpp <https://github.com/orocos-toolchain/log4cpp>`_: Log4Cpp versioned
  for Orocos.

Additional libraries
++++++++++++++++++++

The libraries developed to complement the Orocos project are also distributed
openly and can be found through the following links.

- `KDL <https://github.com/orocos/orocos_kinematics_dynamics>`_: an application
  independent framework for modeling and computation of kinematic chains.
- `BFL <https://gitlab.kuleuven.be/rob-orocos/bfl>`_: an application
  independent framework for inference in Dynamic Bayesian Networks, i.e.,
  recursive information processing and estimation algorithms based on Bayes'
  rule.
- `rFSM <https://github.com/orocos/rFSM>`_: a small and
  powerful statechart implementation in Lua.
  `Main author's version <https://github.com/kmarkus/rFSM>`_.

Ros integration
+++++++++++++++

The next additional bundles integrates Orocos concepts into the ROS ecosystem.

- `rtt_ros_integration <https://github.com/orocos/rtt_ros_integration>`_:
  Integration between Orocos and ROS 1.
- `rtt_ros2_integration <https://github.com/orocos/rtt_ros2_integration>`_:
