What is the Orocos Component Library?
=====================================

This library contains user contributed software components of the `Open
Robot Control Software <http://www.orocos.org>`__ project.

Component Documentation
=======================

Each component or group of associated components has a manual of its own
and are available in the API documentation. The following documents are
available:

-  Component `API Reference <https://orocos.github.io/ocl/toolchain-2.9/api/html/>`__: Overview of the
   functions of all components.

-  `TaskBrowser Component Manual <orocos-taskbrowser.html>`__: the
   interactive console for communicating with any kind of component.

-  `Reporting Component Manual <orocos-reporting.html>`__: a component
   which can read most component data ports and save data periodically
   into a file.

-  `Deployment Component Manual <orocos-deployment.html>`__: a component
   which can be used to load and configure components in the same
   process.

-  Lua RTT Manual (TODO) Use Lua to script deployments,
   components and services.
