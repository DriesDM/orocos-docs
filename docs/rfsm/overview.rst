rFSM is a small and powerful Statechart implementation. It is mainly designed
for Coordination of complex systems but is not limited to that.
rFSM is written in pure Lua and is therefore highly portable and embeddable.
As a Lua domain specific language rFSM inherits the extensibility of its host
language.

rFSM is dual licensed under LGPL/BSD.

The documentation also available in
`HTML <https://www.orocos.org/stable/documentation/rFSM/index.html>`_ and
